## Description:
This project analyzes sales transactions and customer data from a bicycle retail business. The dataset includes transactional records, customer demographics, and product details, allowing for deep insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and business performance.

The dataset consists of multiple tables, including raw and cleaned data:
- Transactions_clean: Processed transaction records, including product details, sales dates, customer IDs, and profit margins.
- Customers_clean: Cleaned customer data with demographics, job titles, car ownership, and purchase history.
- Address_clean: Standardized customer address information.
- NewCustomers_clean: Processed data on new customer acquisitions.
- States_AU: Reference table for Australian states.

## Stages:
1. Import data from different sources:
    - Importing data from websites
    - Importing data from Excel
    - Importing data from CSV
    - Importing data from other Google Sheets

2. Data preparation:
    - Data Profiling
    - Data Cleaning
    - Data Quality Assurance

3. Data transformation:
    - Using formulas
    - Working with pivot tables

4. Building an analytical dashboard:
    - Creating visualisations
    - Setting up interactive elements
    - Preparing reports and dashboards

## What's next?
Although Google Sheets is a simple tool for working with data at first glance, but it has a lot of new features to offer, so I plan to practice with updates like "Named functions" and more complex tools.
