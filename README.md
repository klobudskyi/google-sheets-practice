## Stages:
1. Import data from different sources:
    - Importing data from websites
    - Importing data from Excel
    - Importing data from CSV
    - Importing data from other Google Sheets

2. Data preparation:
    - Data Profiling
    - Data Cleaning
    - Data Quality Assurance

3. Data transformation:
    - Using formulas
    - Working with pivot tables

4. Building an analytical dashboard:

    - Setting up interactive elements
    - Preparing reports and dashboards

## What's next?
Although Google Sheets is a simple tool for working with data at first glance, but it has a lot of new features to offer, so I plan to practice with updates like "Named functions" and more complex tools.
